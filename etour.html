            Walk Through Historic Harlem - 
            Visit Sites of Its Golden Age
        </div>

<p>Most people would begin a tour of Harlem at 125th Street, the area's main thoroughfare; however, starting at 145th Street and working your way to 125th Street via 135th Street and Lenox Avenue would reveal more of Harlem's historical past and changing "streetscape."</p>

   <h3 id="convent"><strong>Convent Avenue Baptist Church</strong></h3>
Take the D or A train to 145th Street and exit by the southwest staircase. Turn west on 145th Street and ascend the hill to Convent Avenue. At the corner is the Convent Avenue Baptist Church.  Every January, the church holds a celebration to honor the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The event is open to the public and is usually also attended by mayors, senators, presidential candidates and other dignitaries.<br>

<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>       
 
<h3 id="college"><strong>City College</strong></h3>       
Turn left by the church onto Convent Avenue. At 141st Street is City College. Part of the City University of New York (CUNY), it is one of the largest college campuses in the city.<br>
<br>    
Nine graduates have been Nobel Prize winners in the fields of physics, economics, physiology, medicine and chemistry.<br>
<br>
Six neo-Gothic buildings designed by the architect George Brown Post highlight the college's campus. Framing the surrounding streets are four iron arches. According to the college's Web site (www1.ccny.cuny.edu), "They [the buildings] are superb examples of English Perpendicular Gothic style and are among the first buildings, as an entire campus, to be built in the U.S. in this style." In 1984, the buildings were added to both the state and national registers of historic places.<br>

<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
    

<h3 id="gatehouse"><strong>Gatehouse</strong></h3>
At the south end of the college is its performing arts center, Aaron Davis Hall. For 25 years, it was the home of Aaron Davis Hall, Inc., Harlem's preeminent performing-arts group. However, in October, the organization moved from the City College campus. Now known as Harlem Stage, the group has set up residence in the Gatehouse. The $16 million restored building has offices, a 199-seat theater, and rehearsal space. The building's exterior and its interior brickwork and iron doors have been completely restored.<br>
<br>
Located at 150 Convent Avenue and 135th Street, the Gatehouse was originally built in the 1800s as a pumping station. Designed in the Romanesque Revival style by Frederick S. Cook, it delivered water to New York City from an upstate aqueduct. In 1981, the building was designated a landmark and added to the National Register of Historic Places.<br>
<br>
During its inaugural season at the Gatehouse, Harlem Stage presented three new programs: "WaterWorks," "Harlem Stride" and "Harlem Stage Partners." "WaterWorks" is promoting the works of artists Bill T. Jones and Roger Guenveur Smith, among others. (For more information, refer to www.harlemstage.org.)
<br>

<h3 id="park"><strong>St. Nicholas Park</strong></h3>
Leaving the Gatehouse, turn east, walk a block and enter St. Nicholas Park. The grass is immaculate, lush and still green in late October. The series of steps leading out of the park leaves you on automatic pilot as you are transported from the hill where City College sits into the valley of St. Nicholas Avenue.<br>
<br> 
When you exit the park, turn around to take in the spectacular view of the park from below. It is as if you are peering at a manicured English landscape.<br>
<br>
At St. Nicholas Avenue, be careful. The street is wide and the traffic light for walkers seems to last less than two minutes. Continue up 135th Street, which passes through Striver's Row.  This is Harlem's upper middle-class neighborhood.
<br>            
<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>

<h3 id="schomburg"><strong>Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture</strong></h3>
Still heading east, you will come to Lenox Avenue and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The center is part of the New York City Public Library system. Scholars and the public visit the library to conduct genealogy and research into black history.<br>
Opened in 1926, the library has steadily grown from its original collection of books on black studies. Today, it's a repository for manuscripts, art and artifacts, priceless photographs, archives and rare books.<br>
<br>
In 2006, the Schomburg held an exhibition called "Changing Streetscapes:  New Architecture and Open Space in Harlem." The exhibit explored the reasons why Harlem is now undergoing what some people call its "second renaissance."<br>
<br>
The "Changing Streetscapes" exhibit originated at the Morris Raphael Cohen Library at City College. The college plans to create an archive of the research material and make it available to students and researchers.
<br>

<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
            
<h3 id="125th"></strong>125th Street</strong></h3>
After leaving the Schomburg, walk south down Lenox Avenue to 125th Street. There, you will find that Midtown commercial and retail businesses have discovered the area. Today 125th Street is rapidly becoming 34th Street Uptown.<br>
<br>
The area is filled with businesses that are normally only seen Downtown. For the first time in decades, blacks now can do most of their major shopping in the neighborhood. For clothes, they have their choice among Aerosoles, Payless Shoe Source, Foot Locker, Lane Bryant, Marshall's, Old Navy and H&M.  You'll even find a Starbucks and a Staples.<br>
<br>
Harlem residents can now also bank in their own area. Chase, Commerce, Citibank, Washington Mutual, Bank of America and North Fork have fully operating branches on the street.<br>
<br>
Lining the sidewalk are street vendors peddling books by black authors, incense, videotapes, CDs with Motown and rap music, and clothes with words of inspiration for blacks or bearing the faces of famous blacks.
<br>

<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
    
        
<h3 id="apollo"><strong>Apollo Theater</strong></h3>
At 253 West 125th Street stands Harlem's most well-known destination, the Apollo Theater, the place "Where Stars are Born and Legends are Made," where Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Lena Horne and Paul Robeson sang and Duke Ellington, Count Basie and Louis Armstrong played. The Apollo helped launch the careers of some of America's top black performers from Ella Fitzgerald to Lauryn Hill. (For a complete list of performers who entertained there, visit www.apollotheater.com.)<br>
<br>
Amateur Night, which brought renown to the Apollo, is still held on Wednesday evenings at 7:30. For information on how to compete in the auditions, visit the Apollo's Web site for full details or call (212) 531-5370. To watch a performance, tickets are $29, $24, $17 and $15, plus a $2 facility fee. Amateur Night winners can also try out for the television show "Showtime at the Apollo."<br>
<br>  
There also is the Apollo Legend Series, where you can see stars such as Natalie Cole and Patti LaBelle. General concerts include performers who are not yet legends but are, nonetheless, celebrities.<br>
<br>
The Apollo, like much of Harlem, is undergoing a major restoration. When done, its facade has been repointed and its HVAC, fire alarm, security, audio, theatrical and lighting systems upgraded. The stage was also replaced and two new dressing rooms added.<br>
<br>
The Apollo is on the National Register of Historic Places. It also is a designated city and state landmark.
<br>

<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
    
        
<h3 id="blumstein"><strong>Blumstein Department Store</strong></h3>
Moving along 125th, we come to what remains of the Blumstein Department Store (230 West).  It was there, on September 20, 1958, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was nearly assassinated. A woman, later institutionalized, attacked him with a letter opener. He was rushed to Harlem Hospital, where his chest was opened to remove the blade. <br>
<br>
King wrote in his autobiography that his doctor had told him, "If you had sneezed during all those hours of waiting...your aorta would have been punctured and you would have drowned in your own blood."<br>
<br>
The only visible remnant of Blumstein now is its deteriorating red-and-white sign. The facade of the higher floors is covered in soot. The windows are covered with plywood and loosened plastic that seems unshaken by the wind. Three stores now share the ground-floor where King was attacked.<br>
<br>

More plans are in the works for 125th Street. For instance, city and community leaders are working with Columbia University on a project called "125th River-to-River." The plan is to make major improvements on the street from the Harlem River to the Hudson River.<br>
    <h3><strong>Enjoy your walk!</strong</h3>
